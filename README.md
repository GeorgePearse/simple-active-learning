Just for Instance Segmentation Models.

Tooling for some really simple, heuristic based active learning strategies. Easy to understand, and fast to calculate over a lot of data.

1) Single model, internal differences, e.g. the same object, multiple predictions for different classes. 

2) Literally just the number of objects.

3) 2 models, and their disagreement.
